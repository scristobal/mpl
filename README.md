# MPL [![CI](https://github.com/axiomhq/mpl/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/axiomhq/mpl/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/axiomhq/mpl/graph/badge.svg?token=WCHISH068G)](https://codecov.io/github/axiomhq/mpl) ![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/mpl-lang)

MPL is the language [Axiom](https://axiom.co) designed to query metrics. It takes a piped aproach that is inspired by [APL](https://axiom.co/docs/apl/introduction) and [OxQL](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0463).

The primary design goal is to achive a intuitive and readable language that is optimized for both human and machine consumption.

This repository contains:
- The parser
- The AST generation
- The linter
- The WASM libary
- A simple CLI 'compiler'
- A binary to generate the library documentation
- Typescript bindings
- The typescript language server 
- The Codemirror integration

We provide a playground to try out those parts.
